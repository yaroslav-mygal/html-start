        <blockquote>
          <p>I adopted our son as a newborn after going through 12 years of infertility. Now, 23 years later, I am director at Everlasting Adoptions. Shortly after adopting our son, I started to feel a calling towards adoption. My career as a Human Resource Manager in Corporate America came to an end, and I entered not what I now know is my purpose and passion in life â€” building families through the miracle of adoption.</p>
          <p>Working with birthmothers and adoptive parents throughout the US for over 20 years has allowed me to utilize the skills I have been blessed with to serve others. I come to work every day not as a staff member coming to a job from 9 to 5, but as a person who is extremely dedicated and devoted to helping people like you every single day. I feel very blessed to have found my purpose, and I look forward to helping you with your adoption needs!</p>

home, family, relationship and hobbies, and allows you to express your excitement about growing
your family through adoption. It is your main marketing tool.  We make edits and updates to your

your requirements with regard to information such as all of the race combinations of the baby you are
willing to raise, whether you want a boy or a girl, the type of communication you are comfortable with after
birth, and the amount of financial support you might be able to budget for to help her during her pregnancy.
We take all of these requirements, enter them in our database and then begin the match-making process. It is
important to give some thought to the criteria you will be comfortable with.</p>

If so, you will develop a relationship by texting, emailing, and phone calling, that hopefully leads to a face to face
visit.  This visit usually confirms that this a great match or perhaps reveals that a better match is waiting.  If confirmed
and positive, a legal professional will be hired in the birthmothers state by the adoptive parents.</p>

for an inducement date or you will be flying by the seat of your pants to get to the hospital to perhaps participate 
in delivery.  How exciting!  After delivery, you must wait for the parental relinquishment hours to pass (usually 72 hour or less)
and for the Interstate Compact Placement of Children (ICPC) to clear. Parental relinquishment laws follow the birthmotherâ€™s state,
not yours. You will stay at a nearby hotel during this time, and you are usually assigned as temporary guardians of the baby.  Baby
is typically in your possession after discharge, but sometimes a birthmother will take the baby with her during this waiting

before you come home, and others will dictate that you must finalize in your home state.  A decision is usually discussed between you and
the legal professionals that were hired.</p>
