        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>It all started in the Fall of 2011 with a simple statement: There has to be a better way!</p>
<p>Watching his sister struggle to remotely coordinate shift changes with her boss, Peter Swaniker decided not only to build a better scheduling platform – but a better way for any workforce to interact, optimize and function.  As faith may be, NimbleSchedule was born.</p>
<p>In 2016, as we continued to grow and evolve, we became Ximble.  We will never forget how we started and where we came from. Ximble has that origin coded in its name forever.</p>

              <p>We believe great software is not about the code alone.  It represents the soul of the company that produces it. Believing that great products raise people’s living standards and spread happiness, we bring technology to the world by building robust, collaborative and multi-language software.</p>

We think of other companies we come across in our business as both, the role models and collaborators whom we learn from, or influence. <br> We share a common passion for software and for the world we live in.  Without them, there would likely not be a need for our products.  They make us better and stronger.</p>
